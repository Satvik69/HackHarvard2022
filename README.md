## What it does
ScanAI aims to detect guns in schools and public areas to help alert authorities quickly in the event of a public shooting. 

## How we built it
ScanAI is built entirely out of python. Computer vision python libraries were used including OpenCV, facial_recognition, yolov5 and tkinter.

## Challenges we ran into
When training models, we ran into issues of a lack of ram and a lack of training data. We also were challenged by the problem of tackling multiple faces at once. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
ScanAI is able to take imported files and detect multiple faces at once and apply facial recognition to all of them. ScanAI is highly accurate and has many features including Barack Obama facial recognition, object detection, live webcam viewing and scanning, and file uploading functionalities. 

## What we learned
We all learned a lot about machine learning and its capabilities. Using these modules expanded our knowledge on AI and all its possible uses.
